## Accolite Digital

### Induction Into existing team at Morgan Stanley

`Aug '23-Now`

Current Team
I joined a team in Morgan Stanley that is working on developing data processing pipelines using Scala and Spark. In this team, I have also taken an active role in picking up infrastructure setup work such as integrating a Postgres Database with an existing high demand system, developing Sybase database procs and developing of python scripts and utilities.
_using:_

-   Python: Recently set up a testing framework for an existing old codebase so as to get practices cleaner
-   Scala: Have been using a mix of scala's functional features and traditional SOLID object-oriented java-like design
-   Spark: Has improved my understanding of engineering database and SQL logic
-   Sybase: Has been challenging and interesting to develop for production; unit testing and clean design
-   Working model: Scrum and Kanban

### Morgan Stanley Joining Project

`Feb '23-Aug '23`
When I joined Morgan Stanley as a contractor for Accolite, where I worked in another full stack project using Angular, Spring Boot and Postgres. This was a scrum setup with the 6 other people I went through training with so there was a lot of learning how to take an active role in planning and organising within Scrum, as well as establishing respectful cooperative teamwork and discussion.
_used:_

-   Java/Spring Boot: Persistence Modelling, SOLID design, API engineering and unit testing. Set up and maintained docker encapsulation and CI.
-   Angular: UI design using HTML and SCSS, SOLID design, API access
-   Persistence: Initally used CSVS, but designed and generated from an ER diagram we designed as a team until actual data sources were available. Then moved over to postgres.
-   Working model: Scrum

### Training Project

`Nov '23`
As part of my training, I worked in a full stack project to using angular and spring boot. Most of my work was in front end and UI design. This project was over 2 months.
_used:_

-   Java/Spring Boot: Persistence Modelling, SOLID design, API engineering.
-   Angular: UI design using HTML and SCSS, SOLID design, API access
-   Persistence: MySQL.
-   Deployment model: AWS
-   Working model: Scrum

## Heriot-Watt University

### The Effects of Phonons in 2D Quantum Devices

Supervision : Dr. Erik Gauger and Dr Moritz Cygorek; http://qtt.eps.hw.ac.uk/

Master’s project; computational physics utilising python 3

-   Built in python
-   Moved the Bachelor’s project to 3D, as well as constructing theoretical methods
    for analysis
-   Presented and answered questions on the research subject and computational/programming
    methods
-   Talk, poster presentation and report write-up
-   Also utilised tools in C++ for some analysis methods

### Towards Calculating Phonons in 2D Quantum Devices

`May '21-July '21`

Supervision : Dr. Erik Gauger and Dr Moritz Cygorek; http://qtt.eps.hw.ac.uk/

-   computational physics utilising python 3
-   Object oriented approach to model with numpy for computation
-   All python from the ground up, with advice on direction from supervisors but
    otherwise independent

## Personal Projects

### Unicode

`Dec '20-May '21`
Took part in the Unicode online coding competition, in which weekly challenges were
presented and students from universities were tasked to create coded solutions to these
problems; completed in Python 3.

### Space Apps

`Oct '20`
A 24 hour "code jam" challenge in which I and a team of fellow students organised a presentation
on the importance of airflow modelling for Covid-19 and presented it to a panel of experts.

`Oct '19-Feb '20`

### Watts Up space project

Actively participated in the Heriot-Watt Physics society to plan a balloon with a
payload being sent into space; worked on the hardware and physical design team, planning
retrieval, calculating the required parachute size and organising sourcing for parts.

### Mandelbrot Plot

`Aug '19`
Used MATLAB to produce renders of zooms on the Mandlebrot set, a mathematical
fractal, as an exercise in modelling design, animation and to see the plots.
