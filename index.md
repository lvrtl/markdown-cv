## Projects

## Accolite Digital

`Aug '23-Now`
**Induction Into existing team at Morgan Stanley**

I joined a team in Morgan Stanley that is working on developing data processing pipelines using Scala and Spark. In this team, I have also taken an active role in picking up infrastructure setup work such as integrating a Postgres Database with an existing high demand system, developing Sybase database procs and developing of python scripts and utilities.

_using:_

### Python

Recently set up a testing framework for an existing old codebase so as to get practices cleaner

### Scala

Have been using a mix of scala's functional features and traditional SOLID object-oriented java-like design

### Spark

Has improved my understanding of engineering database and SQL logic

### Sybase

Has been challenging and interesting to develop for production; unit testing and clean design

### Working model

Scrum and Kanban

`Feb '23-Aug '23`
**Morgan Stanley Joining Project**

When I joined Morgan Stanley as a contractor for Accolite, where I worked in another full stack project using Angular, Spring Boot and Postgres. This was a scrum setup with the 6 other people I went through training with so there was a lot of learning how to take an active role in planning and organising within Scrum, as well as establishing respectful cooperative teamwork and discussion.

_used:_

### Java/Spring Boot

Persistence Modelling, SOLID design, API engineering and unit testing. Set up and maintained docker encapsulation and CI.

### Angular

UI design using HTML and SCSS, SOLID design, API access

### Persistence

Initally used CSVS, but designed and generated from an ER diagram we designed as a team until actual data sources were available. Then moved over to postgres.

### Working model

Scrum

`Nov '23`
**Training Project**

As part of my training, I worked in a full stack project to using angular and spring boot. Most of my work was in front end and UI design. This project was over 2 months.

_used:_

### Java/Spring Boot

Persistence Modelling, SOLID design, API engineering.

### Angular

UI design using HTML and SCSS, SOLID design, API access

### Persistence

MySQL.

### Deployment model

AWS

### Working model

Scrum

## Heriot-Watt University

**Master’s project**
`Sept '21-May '22`
"The Effects of Phonons in 2D Quantum Devices"

_Supervision : Dr. Erik Gauger and Dr Moritz Cygorek; http://qtt.eps.hw.ac.uk/_

-   Built in python
-   Moved the Bachelor’s project to 3D, as well as constructing theoretical methods
    for analysis
-   Presented and answered questions on the research subject and computational/programming
    methods
-   Talk, poster presentation and report write-up
-   Also utilised tools in C++ for some analysis methods

**Bachelor's Project**

`May '21-July '21`
"Towards Calculating Phonons in 2D Quantum Devices"

_Supervision : Dr. Erik Gauger and Dr Moritz Cygorek; http://qtt.eps.hw.ac.uk/_

-   computational physics utilising python 3
-   Object oriented approach to model with numpy for computation
-   All python from the ground up, with advice on direction from supervisors but
    otherwise independent

## Personal Projects

`Dec '20-May '21`
**Unicode**

Took part in the Unicode online coding competition, in which weekly challenges were
presented and students from universities were tasked to create coded solutions to these
problems; completed in Python 3.

`Oct '20`
**Space Apps**

A 24 hour "code jam" challenge in which I and a team of fellow students organised a presentation
on the importance of airflow modelling for Covid-19 and presented it to a panel of experts.

`Oct '19-Feb '20`

**Watts Up space project**

Actively participated in the Heriot-Watt Physics society to plan a balloon with a
payload being sent into space; worked on the hardware and physical design team, planning
retrieval, calculating the required parachute size and organising sourcing for parts.

`Aug '19`
**Mandelbrot Plot**

Used MATLAB to produce renders of zooms on the Mandlebrot set, a mathematical
fractal, as an exercise in modelling design, animation and to see the plots.
